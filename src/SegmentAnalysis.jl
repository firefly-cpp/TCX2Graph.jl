Computes various characteristics for a given GPS segment, including total distance, ascent, descent, vertical meters, and gradients.

# Arguments
- `segment_idx::Int`: The index of the segment to analyze from the `overlapping_segments` vector.
- `gps_data::Dict{Int, Dict{String, Any}}`: A dictionary containing GPS trackpoints with properties like latitude, longitude, and altitude.
- `overlapping_segments::Vector{Dict{String, Any}}`: A vector of overlapping segments, where each segment is represented as a dictionary with start and end indices.

# Returns
- `Tuple{Float64, Float64, Float64, Float64, Float64, Float64}`: A tuple containing:
    - `total_distance`: The total distance of the segment in meters.
    - `total_ascent`: The total ascent (positive elevation change) in meters.
    - `total_descent`: The total descent (negative elevation change) in meters.
    - `total_vertical_meters`: The total vertical movement (both ascent and descent) in meters.
    - `max_gradient`: The maximum ascent gradient within the segment (elevation change over distance).
    - `avg_gradient`: The average ascent gradient over the segment, considering only ascent portions.

# Details
This function computes various metrics over a segment of GPS data defined by its start and end indices in `overlapping_segments`.
It calculates the distance between consecutive GPS points using the Haversine formula. If altitude data is available, it tracks
the ascent and descent, as well as calculates gradients (ascent per distance). The result is a tuple of characteristics
for the entire segment.
